#Shell script to test Assignments Part 1 and 2 used together.
#This script should be run in a folder containing this script, named test.txt,
#a folder named "Kodak" that contains the 6 Kodak gray scale test files for Assignment Part 2,
#and executables for a Part 1 encoder, a Part 1 decoder, a Part 2 encoder, and a Part 2 decoder.
#To run, type ./test.txt in a UNIX terminal window using the bash shell (as on a Mac in the COSCI lounge).
#
#These names are set to do nothing for Part 2 (cat just passed the bytes through)
#and use bzip2 for part 1.
#Change cat to your Part 2 encoder and decoder and bzip2 to your Part 1 encoder and decoder.
